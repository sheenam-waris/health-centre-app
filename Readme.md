# Health Centre Application

The Health Centre Application is an Android-based solution designed to replace manual record-keeping and management processes at the university's health center. Traditionally, health records for students were maintained through physical health cards, stored in drawers batch-wise, and managed manually. This manual system was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors.

To address these challenges, we developed this application using the following technologies:

* Frontend: Android Studio with Java programming language
* Backend: Node.js
* Database: MySQL

The main goal of this project was to automate the entire health center workflow, making it more efficient and user-friendly. This application serves doctors, staff, and students at college by providing a seamless platform for managing health records, prescriptions, and administrative tasks.
